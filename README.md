# moment.picker

A backbone + moment.js date picker.

## Why another date picker?

I wanted a date picker that did not make too many UI assumptions (forcing you to use a popover/popunder), but did make some assumptions about the environment it was used in (backbone view with events, returning moments).

It tries to be as small as possible, and use libraries that you are already using.

It is suitable to be placed on a screen as is so as to be easily touched (on touch devices)

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via grunt. You'll find source code in the "src" subdirectory!_
