moment.picker
=============

A backbone + moment.js date picker

Requirements
------------

[Moment.js](http://momentjs.com)
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org)

Notes
-----

This is basically compatible with [bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (uses some icon classes).

In it's current state, this library also assumes that you are using [require.js](http://requirejs.org/) modules as this datepicker presents itself as an AMD module.
